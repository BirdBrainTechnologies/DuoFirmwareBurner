Hummingbird Firmware Updater

This repo contains all the files necessary for building the Hummingbird Firmware Burner, an application designed for uploading firmware to the Hummingbird Duo.
We created the project in IntelliJ IDEA, so just import the project into IntelliJ IDEA if you want to work with it.

Note that to run the application on your system, avrdude must be in the working directory with a working avrdude.conf file.
On Windows, it should be called avrdude.exe, on Mac OS X, it should be called avrdude_mac, on 32-bit Linux, it should be called avrdude, and on 64-bit Linux it should be called avrdude64.
